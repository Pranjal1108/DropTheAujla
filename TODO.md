# TODO List for Cloud Outline and Collision Updates

- [x] Update CSS for cloud visuals: Add a transparent outline and adjust the gradient for the inner cloud to white and grayish-offwhite.
- [x] Modify JavaScript collider: Ensure the collider matches the cloud's outline for solid collision detection.
- [x] Update collision logic: Handle bounces and rolls when the character hits the outline, preventing passage through the solid outline.
- [x] Test the changes: Verify that the character cannot pass through the outline and experiences the desired bounce and roll based on the cloud shape.
